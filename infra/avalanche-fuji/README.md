The private-in-name-only key '56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027' is generated by `avalanche-cli` to enable local testing. The key is to a fake local ad-hoc account that is automatically infused with a couple of million of tokens, to enable **local** development and testing only. Bear in mind the key can get generated over and over again by the **publically available** `avalanche-cli`. The tokens have absolutely no value, and they're usable in local environment only. Therefore please note that the "privacy" of the key is in name only. The way the `make` process is currently setup, the key needs to be placed in `/secrets/blockchain_private_key.txt`. This is just a convenience so that you don't have to interact with `avalanche-cli` to get that key every time you start the app.
