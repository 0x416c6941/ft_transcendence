1. Bcrypt - allowed for hashing?
2. User table - add 42 UUID / username NULLable field
3. backend/utils/jwt.ts: process.env.JWT_SECRET - use Docker Secrets instead.
4. backend/routes/users.ts: line 234 and 248 - but only admin check is done for now?
	The same store goes for DELETE user: make admin able
		to remove user accounts
5. JWT - what if user account is deleted? Does JWT still work?
	"auth.ts - authenticateToken":
		Perhaps add here fastify.sqlite check if yes?
6. "Admin" column
7. Special request available by admins and admins only
	to make another user administrator or take admin role from them away

Update tests and swagger docs after all this stuff.
