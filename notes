2. User table - add 42 UUID / username NULLable field
5. JWT - what if user account is deleted? Does JWT still work?
	"auth.ts - authenticateToken":
		Perhaps add here fastify.sqlite check if yes?
8. Display_name -> can't be username (but can be username of that same user)
9. Lowercase vs uppercase check in usernames and display_name
10. Avatar max size check
	Also: should resize the avatar as well? Or could we just
		leave the original resolution?
11. Friends with IO check: can't be friend with your own self

SQL table after users are done:
	but all of this to discuss after users are done, but the main idea
		at least for now is to have two tables:
		tournaments and games, where tournaments contains
			ids of games (1-n? m-n?)

Update tests and swagger docs after all this stuff
	(in the end? doesn't make sense to update each time during development).
