2. User table - add 42 UUID / username NULLable field
4. backend/routes/users.ts: line 234 and 248 - but only admin check is done for now?
	The same store goes for DELETE user: make admin able
		to remove user accounts
5. JWT - what if user account is deleted? Does JWT still work?
	"auth.ts - authenticateToken":
		Perhaps add here fastify.sqlite check if yes?
6. "Admin" column
7. Special request available by admins and admins only
	to make another user administrator or take admin role from them away
8. Display_name -> can't be username (but can be username of that same user)
9. Lowercase vs uppercase check in usernames and display_name
10. Avatar max size check
11. Friends with IO check: can't be friend with your own self

SQL table after users are done:
	but all of this to discuss after users are done, but the main idea
		at least for now is to have two tables:
		tournaments and games, where tournaments contains
			ids of games (1-n? m-n?)

Update tests and swagger docs after all this stuff
	(in the end? doesn't make sense to update each time during development).
